This file contains notes on manual configuration changes that chef does not do
(yet) and require human being to perform them.

- update ubuntu:
  aptitude update && aptitude full-upgrade

- settings adjustments:
  - in brightness and lock: no dim, screen off after 10 min, lock after 30 min (wish could do 15min)
  - mouse and touchpad: show pointer on ctrl, touchpad: disable clicks on touchpad, two finger scroll, enable horizontal scroll
  - appearance: choose wallpaper, behavior: auto-hode launcher, sensitivity high

- change terminal to have light background
  file -> new profile woodenbits, based on default
  change is color scheme to 'black on white'
  edit -> profiles -> make woodenbits default

- change terminal to have deeper scroll buffer (default 512 is not enough, 5k is good)

- install pgld
  aptitude install pgld
  test by pinging ubuntu.com and google.com (guess which one should fail)

- make ubuntu look for updates every two weeks, not daily
  in update manager, settings button, updates tab, change dropdown, save

- make alt-tab switch only applications and disable delayed window shifting
  run Compiz config settings manager
  select ubuntu unity plugin
  select switcher tab
  uncheck 'automatically grid windows on timer in switcher'

- customize file /etc/uswsusp.conf to not do compression and to set image size to 1

- modify /etc/fstab
  - prepend those options to ext4 mounts: noatime
  - prepend those options to ext4 mounts if SSD: discard
  - add following line to put tmp files in memory
      none /tmp tmpfs defaults 0 0
    or
      tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,mode=1777 0 0
- install dropbox and google voice plugins as outlined in
  http://www.techdrivein.com/2012/06/25-things-i-did-after-installing-ubuntu.html
  Note: this can be automated somehow, but not to great extent.

- install firefox desktop configuration that allows easy running of multiple profiles
  TODO this should be automated SOON
