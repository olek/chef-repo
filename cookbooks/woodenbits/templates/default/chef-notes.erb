This file contains notes on manual configuration changes that chef does not do
(yet) and require human being to perform them.

- update ubuntu:
  aptitude update && aptitude full-upgrade

- settings adjustments:
  - in brightness and lock: no dim, screen off after 10 min, lock after 30 min (wish could do 15min)
  - mouse and touchpad: touchpad: disable clicks on touchpad, two finger scroll, enable horizontal scroll
      even better - on thinkpads turn that touchpad off right there
  - appearance: choose wallpaper, behavior: auto-hide launcher

- change terminal to have light background
  file -> new profile woodenbits, based on default
  change is color scheme to 'black on white'
  whilet there, change terminal to have deeper scroll buffer (default 512 is not enough, 5k is good)
  edit -> profiles -> make woodenbits default

- in 'text entry' preferences add ukrainian kbd, make double-shift switch layout
- in keyboard shortcuts create ctrl-alt-R custom shortcut to /usr/local/bin/resize.rb
- run gnome-tweak-tool, remap CapsLock to Control, show pointer on ctrl

- install pgld
  aptitude install pgld
  test by pinging ubuntu.com and google.com (guess which one should fail)

- make ubuntu look for updates every two weeks, not daily
  in update manager, settings button, updates tab, change dropdown, save

- make alt-tab switch only applications and disable delayed window shifting
  run Compiz config settings manager
  select ubuntu unity plugin
  select switcher tab
  uncheck 'timed automatic to show live preview in the switcher'

- customize file /etc/uswsusp.conf to not do compression and to set image size to 1
  either setting is more than questionable now, just let it be

- modify /etc/fstab
  - prepend those options to ext4 mounts: noatime
  - prepend those options to ext4 mounts if SSD: discard
  - add following line to put tmp files in memory
      tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,mode=1777 0 0

- edit /etc/default/grub, remove 'quiet splash' from options, that makes for more informative boot/shutdown

- turn off online search results in HUD (amazon etc)
    Settings -> Security & Privacy -> Search -> Include online search results

- configure truecrypt
  - get vaults
  - mount them using tc-mount command
  - start trucrypt UI and add all mounted as favorites
  - in 'Startup Applications" add ~/bit/truecrypt-init.sh

- install dropbox and google voice plugins as outlined in
  http://www.techdrivein.com/2012/06/25-things-i-did-after-installing-ubuntu.html
  Note: this can be automated somehow, but not to great extent.
